# Psychology Research Project - Vertical Discrimination and Dominance

## Project Overview

"Previous research has shown that dominant individuals frequently think in terms of dominance hierarchies, which typically invoke vertical metaphor 'upper' and 'lower' class, thusly was predicted that when presented with stimuli, would more accurately discern shapes/patterns on the vertical axis..."

Essentially, in the case of:
* Size differentiation (size of dot vs. another different sized dot)
* Character differentiation (`p` vs. `q`)

We want to determine whether or not dominant people can more accurately discern these differences on a vertical axis, than those who are not dominant.
