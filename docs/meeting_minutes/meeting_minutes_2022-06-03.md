# Meeting Minutes: 2022/06/03
Attendees: Zeke, Jeff, Luke

## Notes
* Our differences from original study:
    * No focus task
    * Just dot stimulii
    * Dots may be the same size.

## Trials
* Each trial is has a pair of dot stimulii.
* There are 5 sizes of dots (XS, S, M, L, XL).
* Trials are done in horizontal and vertical oreintations.
* Orientations are done in blocks.
* Blocks alternate (2 vertical blocks and 2 horizontal blocks)
```
    trials = pairings of dots = (5 dot sizes) * (5 dot sizes) = 25 trial types
    trial types = 25 trials * (2 orientations) = 50 unique trial types
    block = (25 trial types in a single orientation) * 2 = 50 trials
    (2 vertical blocks) * (2 horizontal blocks) = 4 alternating blocks
    (4 alternating blocks) * (50 trials/block) = 200 experimental blocks
```
