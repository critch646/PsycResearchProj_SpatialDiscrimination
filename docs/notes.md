Project Details:
	Time frame: let's try and get it done before the summer? (they want to run the experiment over the summer?)
	will get powerpoint as reference point

Spec Details:
	11.5in white outlined boxes on the 4 edges (up, down, left right) of 			screen
	
Experiment Details:
	random horizontal/vertical 'p/q' == 100 of each! 200 total..?
		key pressing input "up/down OR 'p'/'q'"
			interested in reaction time!
		spatial discrimination task
			which one is bigger? (different sized dots and circles) 
				BIGGER dominant?
	 		What degree of difference can people actually notice?


Basic run-down of the program and how it will go?

	FIXATION - 1000 ms

	**** MAKE SURE THAT FIXATION IS CENTERED EACH TIME.****

	LOOP:

		FLASH OF IMAGE - ??? Human reaction time? 100 ms to start with

		correct resp - 200 ms pause before next image

		incorrect resp - 1500 ms w/ "incorrect" (with focus on recentering?)

	END-OF-LOOP (when images run out.)
